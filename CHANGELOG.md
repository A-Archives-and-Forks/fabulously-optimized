## 1.16.5

### 1.9.1

* Several mods updated
* Sodium Extra update skipped because it temporarily changes the UI

### 1.9.0

New mods
* **FerriteCore** - reduces RAM usage 
* **LazyDFU** - improves startup speed even more
* **Better Beds** - improves FPS when around beds (villager farms, anyone?)

Other stuff
* Lots of mod updates
* The new mods were suggested by the community, thank you!

### 1.8.0

New mods
* **EntityCulling Fabric/Forge** - stops rendering entities that are behind a wall, useful in large servers and mobfarms

Other stuff
* SmoothBoot's config system slightly changed and it is now smaller
* Mods updated

### 1.7.1

New mods:
* **No Fade** - makes game startup and resourcepack loading faster by removing some animations

Other stuff
* Sodium Extra got an update with many new toggles, check them out!
* Jumploader got support for Microsoft Accounts, so you can upgrade now when Mojang asks you to (only if you use CF or vanilla launcher)
* Fixed zoom key by unbinding the save toolbar activator by default (that option was always there... oops)
* 25k download milestone! Thank you all for the support!
* Mods updated
* Yes, I added another new mod but I felt like that one didn't warrant a new major update lol, it also might get included with 'Slight' Gui Modifications later on

### 1.7.0

New mods:
* **Hydrogen** - somewhat reduces RAM usage (in my case 2,8 GB -> 2,6 GB)

Other stuff:
* Several mods updated
* The modpack size is much bigger for Curseforge now, because Hydrogen is an external mod
* Sodium Extra update currently skipped as the next version will fix an issue
* Cull Leaves changed the way its config works - if you are upgrading, you may delete the json5 file

### 1.6.0
New mods
* **Sodium Extra** - adds toggles to Sodium settings: animations, particles, weather, fog, FPS indicator

Other stuff
* Updated mods

### 1.5.2
* Hid Minecraft, Jumploader and Cloth API from Mod Menu (because they are not really mods, but dependencies)
* Updated mods

### 1.5.1

* Removed Better Mod Button mod as it is now redundant 
* Not Enough Crashes received a lot of updates for better detection and compatibility
