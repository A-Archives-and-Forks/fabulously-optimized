about: Suggest a new mod to be included in Fabulously Optimized, client-only mods are preferred
title: ''
labels: mod

<!--- 
    Before you request a mod, please search if it has already been requested: https://github.com/Madis0/fabulously-optimized/issues
    
    In most cases I only accept mods that work strictly client-side (meaning on every world and server). 
    If you want to suggest a mod that only works in singleplayer and/or needs server support, 
    please elaborate more on why this would benefit everyone and would still keep the gameplay "vanilla-like".

    Don't forget to include any downsides of your suggestion, you know there are some for every mod.
